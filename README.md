# My Stupid Token (MST)

My Stupid Token (MST) is a template of a basic [ERC-20 token](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20). It uses the set of Solidity contracts provided by OpenZeppelin ([here](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/contracts)). 

It's the easiest way of creating your own asset (or 'currency') on Ethereum. Once the contracts are deployed, all the supply is sent to your own address.
